perimenopause = """Perimenopause:

Perimenopause usually starts sometime during a woman’s mid-40s and can last for several years (in some cases even longer, such as up to 10 years). It’s common during this time to experience irregular periods, breakthrough bleeding and other signs that reproductive hormones are shifting.

Perimenopause is the natural progression in life where you start to experience subtle hormonal declines in estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA and melatonin. You will also experience an increase in FSH (follicle stimulating hormone).  You may also have greater imbalances in thyroid function and cortisol levels during this time.  When you transitioned through puberty your hormones were on the rise, however during peri-menopause hormones are on the decline and because of this you can begin to experience uncomfortable menopausal symptoms. Both puberty and perimenopause are both normal stages of life where symptoms can be minimal if you know how to support your body. How you ate, moved and managed stress prior to peri-menopause is very different when hormones begin to decline.  With this in mind, you can’t put the same amount of pressure onto your body, nor eat the same volume of food, or exercise as hard, to see the results that you once did.

With this in mind, we recommend that you focus on the following:
Eat protein for breakfast every day, and emphasize it at every meal from diverse sources
Avoid ALL snacking
Consume less calories overall in order to maintain your weight as you get older. Due to a decrease in muscle mass and the slowing of your metabolism, it’s more important than ever protein foods, limit processed foods and focus on eating a clean diet.
Eat cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage as it contains indole 3 carbinol which naturally helps to balance estrogen levels. These veggies are also high in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K and electrolytes which are important for blood pressure and heart health.
Eat a phytoestrogen-plant based rich diet to counteract the effects of the hormonal imbalances. Include flaxseeds, oats, sesame seeds, apples, and grated carrots.
Eat phytonutrients by eating the rainbow of different whole food colours everyday (red, orange, yellow, green, blue-purple).
Include plenty of essential minerals and healthy anti-inflammatory omega 3 fats such as fish, seafood, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and flaxseed oil. By filling up on foods which are “hormone-balancing,” nutrient-dense and unprocessed can help you eliminate your intake of empty calories and manage weight gain.
Eat fibre to balance your production of estrogen. Best sources include nuts, seeds, legumes/beans, avocado, veggies and fruit.
Reduce your stress and guard your sleep - poor sleep is linked with higher levels of morning cortisol, decreased immunity, trouble with work performance, and a higher susceptibility to anxiety, weight gain and depression. To allow your body to recover from stress, control your appetite and improve energy, aim to get 7–9 hours of sleep every night.
Include probiotics into your diet.  These are healthy bacteria that improve your production and regulation of key hormones like insulin, ghrelin and leptin. They’re even capable of raising immune function and protecting cognitive functioning. The best probiotic foods include yogurt, kefir, cultured veggies such as sauerkraut or kimchi, kombucha and other fermented foods.
The restorative exercise program is highly recommended (build muscle mass through resistance training 2-3 times per week and increase cardiovascular fitness 1-2 times weekly) to improve body weight, sleep quality, insomnia, bone density, muscle mass and inflammation."""

postmenopausal = """Post-menopause:

Because you are post-menopausal, we recommend a regular strength training program as well as doing a minimum of 2 ½ hours of moderate aerobic training each week. The restorative exercise program is highly recommended to support body weight, sleep quality, insomnia, bone density, muscle mass and inflammation.

To keep your bones strong:  After menopause, you are at a higher risk for developing osteoporosis due to the lower levels of estrogen. Strength training, adequate vitamin D levels, foods high in calcium, and following our whole foods meal plans each week will support your bones and cardiovascular health.  

We recommend eating a plant-based diet that incorporates phytoestrogens such as flaxseeds or (or flaxseed meal).  These foods are incredible for your hormones and gut health, as well as being rich in essential fatty acids.  
Phytoestrogen foods also include the cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, cabbage), alfalfa sprouts, sesame seeds, fresh apricots, peaches, red grapes, oranges, blueberries, and strawberries.  
Phytoestrogen rich foods help reduce hot flashes, and will also protect your heart.
Avoid ALL snacking

Keep alcohol to a minimum as it contributes to hard to shift weight gain.

To allow your body to recover from stress, control your appetite and improve energy, aim to get 7–9 hours of sleep every night.

Symptoms can occur when withdrawing from even 1 double shot of coffee per day. Headaches, anxiety, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, mood changes, cognitive effects are the common symptoms.

Most common methods of decaffeination involve chemical solvents, usually ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, which is worse for your health than having caffeinated coffee.

alcohol_free_nights_per_week = """It is sensational hearing that you are committed to reducing your alcohol consumption. By doing this, you are making a significant change to your health as well as improve your mental performance, energy, mood, hormonal and gut health.  

When you choose to drink alcohol, watch that you only drink X2 100ml glasses of wine if you are small in stature or X2 x 200ml if you are a larger frame. If you drink more than this you are exceeding the Australian requirements of alcohol. When you drink alcohol, your body has to take care of the alcohol you have consumed first because it is a harmful toxin, and puts off all the other important jobs your liver needs to do in order for you to have peak physical and mental health.
